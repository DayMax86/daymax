        <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
          LinguaSyne was built as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
        </p> <p>
          This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
        </p> <p>
          If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
          used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
          To use the Service, you will be required to share your email address in order to create an account. Account authentication is handled by Google's Firebase service
          meaning your password cannot be seen by anyone and is fully encrypted. I, the developer, am able to see your email address, and if you choose to upload a profile image 
          (not doing so does not affect functionality of the app) I will have access to view said image. No other personal data is collected, used or handled by LinguaSyne.

            I do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
            I discover that a child under 13 has provided
            me with personal information, I immediately
            delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with
            personal information, please contact me so that
            I will be able to do the necessary actions.
